# Changelog

Changes in upcoming and published releases. See the [README](README.md) for features,
downloads and installation.

## Unreleased

- Fixed ShrinkIt extraction after viewing HGR/DHGR images: the LZW dictionary no longer overwrites main memory through the graphics banking switches.
- Fixed extraction progress: show each file from the start, with its archive position, progress bar and extracted byte count.

## [0.6.6](https://github.com/habib256/a2filecmd/releases/tag/v0.6.6) — 2026-09-08

- Added ShrinkIt (`.SHK`, stored/LZW/1/LZW/2) and Binary II (`.BNY`) extraction.
- Added readable Applesoft listings, an AppleWorks word-processing viewer, byte comparison and text search.
- Added a bootable 32 MB `.2mg` with a complete `DEMO/` collection; floppy images now carry the program without demos.
- Fixed launching and returning from a program installed in any directory; the hard-disk volume is named `/A2FILEHD`.
